In this project, I will be creating a to-do list application. I will use webpack as my bundler, and separate my projects functionality into multiple modules based on the way they are used. I will use npm to install the "date-fns" library to help with formatting dates. This application will be able to create multiple projects in which a user can create to-do task items. They will be able to add information to their to-do tasks such as a name, date, time, and additional notes. They will also be able to track tasks they have completed, as well as have the ability to delete individual tasks or whole projects. When a task has the same due date as the current day, it be displayed as a priority task. Local storage will be used to load previous users data.
