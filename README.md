In this project, I will be creating a to-do list application. I will use webpack as my bundler, and separate my projects functionality into multiple modules. I will use npm to install the "date-fns" library to help with formatting dates and times. This application will be able to create multiple projects in which a user can create to-do items. They will be able to add information to their to-do items such as a description, time due, date due, and the priority of the item.
